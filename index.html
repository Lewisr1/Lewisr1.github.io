        <p>We are a British based manufacturer of heating and cooling coils.</p>
        <p>Established in 2002, we offer a wide range of heater matrices,
            evaporators, condensers and copper connections supplying into
            the vehicle heating and cooling market to include cars, buses, trucks and agricultural vehicles.</p>
        <p>We offer our customers short lead times and competitive prices with a very personal service,
            and specialize in small to mid quantity batches. We can meet specific design requirements
            or match replacement units from customers drawings or samples.</p>
        <p>Our coils are all produced with copper tubing in either 8mm or 3/8” tube
            with aluminium fins ranging from 8 to 26 fins-per-inch.</p>

                <h2>Heater Matrix</h2>
                <p>These are typically produced using our 26 fins-per-inch construction
                    with 8mm OD copper tube which gives outstanding performance.</p>
                <p>We have a range of plastic top tanks which serve as manifolds,
                    but also offer a wide range of copper manifolds which enable
                    pipe positions to be moved to customers requirements –
                    these can range from 3/8” OD tube to 28mm OD tube.</p>

                <h2>Condensers/Evaporators</h2>
                <p>These are typically produced using a fin construction ranging from 8 FPI
                    up to 20 FPI with 3/8” OD copper tube. The higher fins-per-inch
                    can be used to achieve a varying range of heating coils from the standard 8mm tube.</p>
                <p>Fins can be produced from 1 row (16mm) to 12 row (192mm) and
                    width and depth can be specified by the customer.</p>
                <p>All work is carried out at our plant in Leeds and gives us total control
                    over production to meet our customers needs.</p>
